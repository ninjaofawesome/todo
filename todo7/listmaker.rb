# Create a test for a method`make_list` that takes an array and returns that same array but
# as an array of strings in a numbered list.

# Run this test by typing `rspec list_maker_spec.rb` in your terminal.

# Then, create a method on array called `make_list` that iterates over the array it is
# called on and appends a number, a period, and a space to each element.

# e.g make_list(["ich", "ni", "san"]) #=> ["1. ich", "2. ni", "3. san"]



def make_list
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
	array_2 = array.replace(["number 1", "number 2", "number 3", "number 4", "number 5", "number 6"])
	make_list = array_2.replace(["1. number 1", "2. number 2", "3. number 3", "4. number 4", "5. number 5", "6. number 6"])
end

puts make_list

# my answer was probably not correct.  Here's how everyone did it.

# def make_list(array)
# 	y = []
# 	number = 0
# 	array.each do |x|
# 	number +=1
# 	y << "#{number}. #{x}"
# end
# end

# And here it is refactored:

# def make_list array
# 	y = []
# 	array.each_with_index do |x, index|
# 		y << "#{index+1}. #{x}"
# 	end
# 	y
# end

# OR

# def make_list array
# 	y = []
# 	array.map_with_index { |x, index| "#{index + 1}. #{item}"
#  	}
# end

# Something I was playing around with. Disregard
# array =	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# array_2 = array.join(',')
